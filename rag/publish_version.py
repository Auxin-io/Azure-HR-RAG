"""Push the current INSTRUCTIONS to the migrated (versioned) copy of the agent.

    python rag/publish_version.py

Why this exists: create_agent.py talks to the classic Assistants API. When
you click "Save as new agent" in the portal, Foundry copies the agent into
the versioned agent API, and from then on the two are independent - editing
the classic one does not touch the copy the playground and Copilot use.
This script publishes a new version of that copy with the instructions from
create_agent.py, keeping its model and tools as they are.
